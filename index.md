### A bit about me:
I’m 31, married and have a 2-year-old daughter named Evie (Yes, she is named after the Pokémon). I have previously studied and completed a Certificate 3 in business while working as an IS support officer for the Western Australian Police. I have also done some side study with AutoCAD and Architecture. After finishing these I realised I wasn’t passionate about that line of work and chose not to pursue it. In my spare time I play games online like DotA 2 with friends which I have played competitively. Before DotA 2 was released I was ranked 1st in the world on HoN (Heroes of Newearth).

### My Interest in IT started:
As I was growing up, I always had a computer due to my mum being in an IT Support/Security Officer for the government. I was always helping her in the office with small jobs from cabling to installing computers. (Now that I look back, I was clearly getting used to do the stuff she didn’t want to do). My background in IT support has given me a solid foundation in IT but after not doing a great deal for almost 10 years I feel like it can use a refresher.

### I chose to come to RMIT:
To further my IT background and experience, and the course RMIT was running with OUA was best suited to what I wish to learn in an It degree, and as it is an online course, I am able to fit my study around my work and family life. 

### I expect to learn during my study:
The fundamentals of programming and how I can further my career in the IT industry by using what’s taught at RMIT in the workplace. 

### My ideal job is: 
A Senior Software Engineer

### My description of the job advertisement:
The above position I feel is going to be what most mining companies will be doing in the next 5-10 years. Virtualization of mine sites through graphic design and programming. This position is looking for senior software engineers to support what looks like their own 3D visual program.

### My description of skills required:
The main requirement for this roll is the degree in computer science. C++ programming skills and 3D developments background. This to me means someone with experience in game design would be preferable. Most of the programming/ 3D modelling requirements would come from experience in the gaming industry or similar field.

### The skills I currently have:
Strong mathematics, self-motivated and communication sills due to my previous rolls in management positions. I feel that by completing my current degree in IT this will be a steppingstone into a computer science degree to further my programming skills and computer mathematics.

### My Plan:
I plan on completing my degree in IT while also looking for a junior or similar roll in programming/development. I will continue to gain the required skills in the C++ and 3D modelling areas by either studying another degree/short course or through career advancement in IT positions. This will take a few years while I work full time, study full time and raise my young daughter.

### Tests Results:

![Myers-Briggs test](https://github.com/LukeGreen88/A1/blob/master/Personality%20Test.PNG)
![Learning Style test](https://github.com/LukeGreen88/A1/blob/master/Learning%20Style%20Test.PNG)
![Working Style test](https://github.com/LukeGreen88/A1/blob/master/Working%20Style%20Test.PNG)

The results from the three tests above are accurate in describing my personality and working style. The defender personality seems quite reserved but they have good analytical skills which is very much like me. The work style test also reinforces what is said in the Myers-Briggs test by saying that I am very self-improvement oriented and always willing to go the extra mile. I do feel that over time these results would change depending on life experiences and my study. The learning style test doesn’t really reflect my style of learning but some of the recommendations of how-to study will certainly help as I further my self-improvement.

The results of the test themselves would not influence my behaviour in a team as it has only labelled my personality type and does not define how I must work or run a team. If they were to influence it, it would show I have the motivation to learn and have a passion for perfectionism and in a team I would be the centre of knowledge and a platform for others to work from, but it also shows I would probably get taken advantage of as my knowledge may be taken by others personal gain.

As a Defender I would hope to have in my team similar people like myself which are object orientated, motivated and strive for perfection. The team would also require management that has clear goals and an object focused mind but someone that can also think outside the box and excite the team with new ideas. I feel that the team would require a personality that entertains and keeps the team moral up so they can stay motivated end enjoy their workplace.






### My project Idea:
My idea is to create a website that allows game developers and programmers to show off their ideas and projects that they are currently working on and give them more visibility to the public. This could also be used for a CV for people of the IT world to show off their previous experience and projects, that they have done (Similar to the website www.imdb.com). I would also like to be able to showcase different things that people are working on to promote the projects or ideas.

My motivation to this isn’t to show off my CV but to allow people to connect. The world is slowly getting smaller and as more and more people gain access to the internet, there is now no limit to where people can work from. In a few years I can see more people being hired from other countries due to experience then what is locally available. As more things become internet based, so will jobs. People in the IT profession need not be in an office to do work but could sit at home from the other side of the world and remote access into a programming project or design. 

The main part of my project would be programmers and designers’ profiles. This would include some of the following:
*	Their personal details and information about them.
*	Projects they have or are working on.
*	If they are currently available for hire.
*	Salary/wage they will work for.
*	Blogs or updates of current projects and issues they are facing.
There would also be a social side to this area as-well. We would give people the ability to message and linkup to others that have similar background to discuss projects.

The project would also give the ability for indie developers to show off their skills with games or designs that they are currently working on. This would give people the chance to advertise their idea to the public and if people are interested either help, hire, buy or publish the idea for the person. (This would possibly be like the site www.kickstarter.com) but could also have the ability for other programmers to “buy-in” to a project idea and help develop or fund with the intention if it does well, they could get a cut in the proceeds.

Another feature of my project would be global job postings and advertisements. This would be more focused on companies that are looking to have remote teams. They might not choose to advertise what they are producing on the website, but they could ask for expressions of interest in a certain category. 
The next part would be advertisement of finished projects and games. There are more indie developers making games now than ever before, so being able to have a new game or program advertised could help the developer and exposes others to things that they might not often see.

News, featurettes and interviews would also be something that could give free publicity to smaller projects that are needing help and updates of bigger developments could be of interest to a certain crowd of people.
The business model behind this idea would be selling peoples skills. There are more people than ever on the internet and if larger companies wanted to have premium access to a full database of potential employees they could. They would have the ability to filter people’s degrees, experience, previous projects and their CV. The other part would be advertising people’s ideas, be it, an already in development game, a program idea pitch or even a website that needs some unique coding. Job seekers/developers could also pay to be highlighted to show they are actively seeking work or help in a project.

### Tools and technologies:
Most tools and technology needed for this project is readily available as most of it would be web based and would mainly need coding and design. 

### The skills required:
The main skills required for this project would be coding and website development. It would also need a journalist of some sort to write news and featurettes and someone to advertise the website to get the idea out there. Most of the above skills are openly available but finding people that would be interested in the project would be the first part.

If this project was successful it would bring developers and designers closer together with the ability to share and help each other. It would also help show new things that are available for people who are interested in IT and programming. The main impact this project would have is people in the development side of things would have more recognition, more chances for jobs and the possibility of connecting with others like them. This project currently would only focus on the programming and development side of things but could also extend out in other professions that want to advertise jobs globally.
